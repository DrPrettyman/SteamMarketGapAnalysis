## What Hiring Managers Care About (And Don't)

When reviewing portfolios, hiring managers spend approximately three minutes deciding whether to engage further. They evaluate:

**Critical factors:**
- Problem-solving capability for business challenges
- Communication clarity and effectiveness
- Alignment with company needs

**Factors that don't matter:**
- Project quantity (quality supersedes volume)
- Trendy library usage
- Extensive certifications
- Unnecessary complexity
- Artificially high accuracy scores

## The Projects That Actually Matter

**Mistake to avoid:** Stop using datasets like Titanic, iris, and standard Kaggle beginner projects. Every hiring manager has encountered these repeatedly.

### Project Type 1: Real Business Problems

Focus on genuine challenges companies face:

**Customer Churn Prediction:** Show business impact with cost-benefit analysis. Demonstrate how interventions save money.

**Pricing Optimization:** Provide actionable recommendations with revenue projections based on actual data analysis.

**Inventory Management:** Calculate stockout costs versus excess inventory expenses with specific recommendations.

> **Key principle:** "Answer a business question, don't just make predictions."

### Project Type 2: Industry-Specific Analysis

Target your portfolio to match employer needs. Healthcare companies need healthcare projects; e-commerce requires retail analysis. This demonstrates industry familiarity.

### Project Type 3: End-to-End Workflow

Complete pipeline includes:
1. Obtaining messy data (scraping, APIs, multiple sources)
2. Cleaning with documented problems and solutions
3. Exploratory analysis yielding genuine insights
4. Building models, dashboards, or recommendations
5. Communicating actionable results

---

## Project Documentation Standards

**Required README sections:**

1. **Problem statement** (one clear sentence)
2. **Business impact** (quantified metrics, even estimates)
3. **Methodology** (brief approach overview)
4. **Key findings** (bullet-point insights)
5. **Action items** (specific recommendations)

Keep documentation under 500 words.

---

## Technical Code Quality

Your code should demonstrate:
- Functions with docstrings
- Descriptive variable naming
- Comments explaining reasoning
- Organized structure (avoid massive notebooks)

Include Jupyter notebooks or reports walking through analytical thinking with visualizations, context, analysis, approach, and recommendations sections.

## Common Portfolio Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too many projects**
Ideal: 3-5 high-quality examples

**Mistake 2: Missing context**
Every project needs clear README with business context

**Mistake 3: Accuracy focus**
Shows misunderstanding of metrics; emphasize precision-recall tradeoffs instead

**Mistake 4: No visualizations**
Professional charts and dashboards are essential

**Mistake 5: Tutorial copying**
Personalize learned techniques with different datasets or questions

## Hosting and Presentation

**GitHub:** Non-negotiable platform for code and documentation

**Personal website:** Optional but valuable (includes introduction, featured projects, contact information)

**Blog posts:** Medium articles demonstrating communication skills

**Avoid:** Scattering work across multiple platforms

---

## Project Description Template

**Structure:**
- Clear, specific title
- One-line summary
- 2-3 sentence context explaining business value
- Bullet-point methodology
- Quantified results and impact
- Technologies used
- Links to repositories and dashboards

**Resume format:**
> "Built [solution] to [problem]. Achieved [metrics]. Impact: [business outcome]. [Link]"

---

## Impact Quantification

For personal projects using public data, provide estimated impact:

> "If implemented at a company with [parameters], this model could [outcome]. At [cost/value], that's [total impact]."

State assumptions and show calculations.

## Core Principle

> "Your portfolio is not about showing off every skill you have. It's about proving you can solve the kinds of problems the company needs solved."

Build projects companies would pay for. Three excellent projects outperform ten mediocre ones. Simplify navigation to help busy hiring managers quickly assess your value.

Most candidates won't invest this effort, creating competitive advantage for those who do.
