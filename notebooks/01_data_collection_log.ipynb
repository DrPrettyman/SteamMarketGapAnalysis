    "## Data Quality & Bias Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known Biases (documented honestly)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection bias:** Friend-graph crawling over-represents socially connected users. Isolated accounts (no friends, private profiles) are systematically excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Survivorship bias:** Only public profiles are visible. Users who set profiles to private may have different gaming patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Playtime ≠ enjoyment:** Idle hours, AFK farming, and background running inflate playtime. We flag extreme outliers (>99.9th percentile) but cannot fully correct for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SteamSpy owner estimates:** ±20–30% uncertainty for smaller titles. Ranges are wider for games with fewer data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Price is current, not historical:** Doesn't account for launch discounts, seasonal sales, or bundle deals. Revenue estimates are upper-bounded by this.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **RAWG coverage gaps:** Not all Steam games exist in RAWG. Match rate documented above. Unmatched games tend to be very small/niche titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "- All revenue estimates state explicit assumptions\n",
    "- We report ranges (25th–75th percentile), not point estimates\n",
    "- Bias discussion is included in every notebook that produces quantitative claims"
